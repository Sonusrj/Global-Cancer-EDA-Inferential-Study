# 🌍 Global Cancer EDA & Statistical Analysis

A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Inferential Statistical Study on a global cancer patient dataset (50,000 records across 10 countries, 2015–2024).

This project investigates demographic patterns, risk factors, cancer severity, treatment costs, and survival outcomes using structured statistical methods and machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Objective

The primary goal of this study was to:

- Analyse demographic and clinical distributions
- Evaluate relationships between lifestyle/environmental risk factors and cancer severity
- Assess economic patterns in treatment costs across countries
- Validate assumptions using inferential statistical testing
- Examine interaction effects between key risk variables

Rather than relying solely on visual exploration, this project emphasises statistical validation of observed patterns.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- 50,000 patient records
- 10 countries
- 8 cancer types
- Cancer stages: 0–4
- Age range: 20–89
- Features include:
  - Demographics (age, gender, country)
  - Risk factors (smoking, alcohol, obesity, genetic risk, air pollution)
  - Clinical variables (cancer type, stage, severity score)
  - Economic & outcome variables (treatment cost, survival years)

---
## ⚠ Limitations

- The dataset may not fully capture real-world medical complexity
- Limited clinical variables
- Weak linear relationships suggest missing hidden factors

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Apply advanced survival analysis techniques
- Build predictive ML models for severity and survival
- Perform deeper multivariate modeling
- Incorporate longitudinal or hospital-level datasets

Full results and detailed findings are available in the project report. (📂 Repository)
